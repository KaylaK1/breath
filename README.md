## Overview

Documents cases of police misconduct / human rights violations against people of color. Keeps track of legal actions, provides resources to those that want to advocate.

It seems like cases of misconduct go unpunished. This is a website that allows citizens to track and advocate local governments to investigate. It will hopefully also show when misconduct occurs, that appropiate investigation and action was taken by the local governing body.

"Through awareness and education, may a brighter future unfold."
